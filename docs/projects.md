Here's some stuff I'm working on that you might be interested in

## homelab

In the process of doing some home renovations, I finally was able to wire my house with Ethernet, meaning I can finally build homelab complete with a proper wallmount rack and professional-grade equipment. I'm hoping to have a lot to say about this in the future, but the project is on-hold for now. Here's my outline for the project, however:

- 9U short-depth server rack
- Ubiquiti Pro router
- Ubiquiti 24-port switch
- 12-node Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster
- 4-node Ryzen 7 based Kubernetes cluster

The goal is to set up the network and the RPi cluster first, followed by the first of the four Ryzen 7 nodes. Each of the 4 nodes will have the following:

- 1U short-depth server case with HDD hot-swap module
- Ryzen 7 5700G 3.8GHz 8-core CPU
- 64GB DDR4-3600 RAM
- 2x TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus m.2 SSD
- 4x Seagate 5TB 2.5" 5400RPM HDD

I have a [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/EagleRock/saved/#view=Csv4pg) for those like-minded individual who appreciate all the details :smile:

## incremental game

I'm also working on an [incremental game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) in my spare time, which is a good excuse for me to learn some front-end development, including working with [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and TypeScript (okay, I'm not using TypeScript yet, but at least I'm using JSDoc).

The game isn't complete enough for even a demo, but I'll post a link once I have something playable. In the meantime, here's the [GitHub page](https://github.com/eaglerock1337/tomeclicker) if you want to read more about the project!

## more code

I plan on showcasing more coding projects here, but for now, take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/eaglerock1337) page or move on to the [code](code) page for some code snippets!
