"""
Solve Google's 25 horse problem:

You have 25 horses and need to find the three fastest horses in the group.
You can race 5 horses at a time, but do not have a watch.
How many races are required to find the top three horses?

My answer: 7 heats
- Run 5 heats with 5 horses each and get the results.
- Run a championship heat with the fastest horse from each heat.
  - You now have the fastest horse in the group.
- Use the final heat to find the second and third fastest:
  - Second and third fastest horses from the fastest heat
  - First and second fastest horses from the second-fastest heat
  - First horse from the third-fastest heat
- The fastest and second-fastest horse from the seventh heat will give you
  the final two horses to answer the question, and will account for all
  possibilities.
