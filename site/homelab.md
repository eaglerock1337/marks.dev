# homelab






## rack & network

In the process of doing some home renovations, I finally was able to wire my house with Ethernet, meaning I can finally build homelab complete with a proper wallmount rack and professional-grade equipment. I'm hoping to have a lot to say about this in the future, but the project is on-hold for now. Here's my outline for the project, however:

- 9U short-depth server rack
- Ubiquiti Pro router
- Ubiquiti 24-port switch
- 12-node Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster
- 4-node Ryzen 7 based Kubernetes cluster

The goal is to set up the network and the RPi cluster first, followed by the first of the four Ryzen 7 nodes. Each of the 4 nodes will have the following:

- 1U short-depth server case with HDD hot-swap module
- Ryzen 7 5700G 3.8GHz 8-core CPU
- 64GB DDR4-3600 RAM
- 2x TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus m.2 SSD
- 4x Seagate 5TB 2.5" 5400RPM HDD

## more code

I plan on showcasing more coding projects here, but for now, take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/eaglerock1337) page or move on to the [code](code) page for some code snippets!
